# Data Visualization


My exploration with Python data visualisation has been fascinating 
and inspiring. With the help of tools like NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly,
and requests, I was able to create eye-catching visualisations and 
analyse data that was obtained by making API calls.

The flexibility of Matplotlib allowed for the development of 
static, editable visualisations. Plotly introduced an interactive 
element that made dynamic plots possible.

I was able to retrieve real-time data and use it in my 
visualisations by utilising the'requests' library, which became
a mainstay for making API calls. I also refined my data analysis
techniques, exploring methods like exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
to identify patterns and trends.

I realised that narrative is just as important in data 
visualisation as technical aspects. It involves more than just
making charts that are aesthetically pleasingâ€”it also involves
telling a cogent story. This experience has given me a comprehensive
approach to efficiently analysing and communicating data in addition to technical skills.
